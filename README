Mango script is a javascript library that copies the MongoDB Shell
commands and syntax to be used on native javascript objects and arrays.

use:
Mango = createMango({*options*})(); //to inicialise you can use Mango({*options*}) if you wish to change settings
options:
	proto:  true/false // true adds the functions (find) to the array prototype, default:false
	copy : 'superAwesomeCopy'|'deepCopy'|'clone'|'copy' or function //copy function used to make results
		-> default: function superAweSomeCopy(val){return val};

if proto is set use
arr.find(query,options); (options: limit/skip/fields) //like nodejs-native-mongodb driver
if not
Mango.find(arr,query,options);
